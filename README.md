Snips skill to check multiple calendars on Home Assistant

Since this relies on Home Assistant, all day events are not handled well, unless you happen to live in a time zone that matches UTC.  See [issue #25814](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/issues/25814) for more info, at least with caldav calendars.
